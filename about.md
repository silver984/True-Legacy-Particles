# True Legacy Particles

A very faithful recreation of the old particle system for the player vehicle.

#### Read:
This mod utilizes a .plist file called "dragEffect" in the game files. If ever the file gets modified (either through another mod called <co>Texture Loader</c> or by simply changing the game resources) whilst in-game, make sure to restart your game.
